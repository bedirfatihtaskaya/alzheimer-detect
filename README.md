# 🧠 Alzheimer's Detection using Deep Learning  

## 📜 Project Overview  
This project leverages deep learning to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease through MRI brain scans. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and advanced image classification techniques, the model aims to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's, facilitating timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Early Detection**: Classify MRI scans into four categories representing different stages of Alzheimer’s – Non-Demented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia.  
- **Automation**: Develop an automated diagnostic tool to reduce manual interpretation by radiologists.  
- **Data-Driven Diagnosis**: Leverage medical imaging data to improve accuracy and efficiency in Alzheimer’s detection.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **MRI Classification**: Analysis of MRI scans using CNN to detect and classify Alzheimer’s stages with high precision.  
- **Four-Stage Classification**:  
  - 🟢 **Non-Demented**: Normal brain function.  
  - 🟡 **Very Mild Dementia**: Early signs of cognitive decline.  
  - 🟠 **Mild Dementia**: Noticeable memory impairment.  
  - 🔴 **Moderate Dementia**: Significant memory loss and cognitive dysfunction.  
- **Regularization Techniques**: BatchNormalization and Dropout applied to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.  
- **SMOTE for Data Balancing**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) used to address data imbalance.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Data Processing**: `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - **Machine Learning/Deep Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`  
  - **Imbalanced Data Handling**: `imbalanced-learn`  
  - **MRI Data Processing**: `nibabel`, `opencv`  

## 📊 Results  
- Successfully classified Alzheimer’s stages using MRI scans with high accuracy.  
- Provided a tool that assists radiologists in detecting early signs of dementia, potentially speeding up diagnosis.  
- Improved detection rates compared to traditional manual analysis.
